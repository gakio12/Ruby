			<h2>Uses</h2>
			<p>
			One of Ruby's main usages is for using it with the Rails framework. 
			This framework helps making web applications easy and intuitive. 
			Rails provides default structures for a databse, a web application, and web pages.	
			</p>
			<p>
                        Some examples of websites that were built with Ruby on Rails include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>GitHub</li>
                                <li>Airbnb</li>
                                <li>Twitch</li>
                                <li>SoundCloud</li>
                                <li>Hulu</li>
                        </ul>
			<p>
			Ruby itself can be used for a variety of applications. It is a general scripting 
			language so, for example, you can write a simple text file parser with regular 
			expressions. Ruby itself is more similar, in application, to Python and Perl. 
			</p>
			<p>
			From ruby’s website, they describe many other applications that are written in Ruby:
			</p>
			<p>
			Simulations:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia uses ruby to conduct simulations.
				</li>
				<li>
				A research group in Motorola uses Ruby to script a simulator.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
                        3D Modeling:
                        </p>
			<ul>
                        	<li>
				Google SketchUp is a 3D modeling application that uses Ruby for its macro scripting API. By using Ruby scripts, it makes it easy for users to toggle and add different effects and features that they desire while using the application.
                        	</li>
                        </ul>
			<p>
                        Networking
                        </p>
                        	<li>
				Open Domain Server uses Ruby to allow people using dynamic DNS clients to udpate, in real time, their IP configuration so that it can be mapped to static domains. However, Open Domain Server has been shut down since 2015.
                        	</li>
                        </ul>
			<p>
			Applications
                        </p>
                        	<li>
In Toyota Motors manufacturing process “Just-in-Time”, they use Ruby on Rails framework as the web front end for the mission-critical application. 
                        	</li>
                        </ul>
			<p>
			Security
                        </p>
			<ul>
                        	<li>
				Ruby is also being used for some security testing platforms for modern web applications.	
                        	</li>
                        </ul>
			<p>
			Homebrew, a popular open-source package manager for OS X is written entirely in Ruby.
			</p>
			<p>
			Even Jekyll is built with Ruby.
