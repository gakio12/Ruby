			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>
			February 24, 1993 – Ruby is conceived by Yukihiro Matsumoto, in an online 
			conversation with colleague Keiju Ishitsuka. While Ruby is named for a 
			colleague’s birthstone, inspired by the use of a gemstone for Perl, he 
			later realized the following comparisons:
			In birthstones, pearl is June, ruby is July.
			When measuring font sizes, pearl is 5pt, ruby is 5.5pt[1].
			Ruby seemed a natural progression from Perl. In stating his inspiration 
			for the language, “I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful 
			than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python[2].”
