			<h2>Usages</h2>
			<p>
			One of Ruby's main usages is for using it with the Rails framework. 
			This framework helps making web applications easy and intuitive. 
			Rails provides default structures for a databse, a web application, and web pages.	
			</p>
			<p>
                        Some examples of websites that were built with Ruby on Rails include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>GitHub</li>
                                <li>Airbnb</li>
                                <li>Twitch</li>
                                <li>SoundCloud</li>
                                <li>Hulu</li>
                        </ul>
			<p>
			Ruby itself can be used for a variety of applications. It is a general scripting 
			language so, for example, you can write a simple text file parser with regular 
			expressions. Ruby itself is more similar, in application, to Python and Perl. 
			</p>
			<p>
			From ruby’s website, they describe many other applications that are written in Ruby:
			</p>
			<p>
			Simulations:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia uses ruby to conduct simulations.
				</li>
				<li>
				A research group in Motorola uses Ruby to script a simulator.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
                        3D Modeling:
                        </p>
			<ul>
                        	<li>
				Google SketchUp is a 3D modeling application that uses Ruby for its macro scripting API.
                        	</li>
                        </ul>
			<p>
                        Networking
                        </p>
                        	<li>
				Open Domain Server uses Ruby to allow people using dynamic DNS clients to udpate, in real time, their IP configuration so that it can be mapped to static domains.  
                        	</li>
                        </ul>
			<p>

                        	<li>
				It is used in a mission-critical application which forms part of Toyota Motor Manufacturing’s own “sequence-in-time” production process.
                        	</li>
                        </ul>
			<p>

			<ul>
                        	<li>
				Ruby is also being used for some security testing platforms.	
                        	</li>
                        </ul>
			<p>
			Homebrew, a popular open-source package managet for OS X is written entirely in Ruby.
