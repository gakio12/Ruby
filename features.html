			<h2>Features</h2>
                        <h4>Object-Oriented</h4>
                        <p>Ruby is an object-oriented language. In fact, everything is an object! Because of this, everything in Ruby has a <code>self</code> pointing as the class associated with that object. This allows for powerful code, as there are no boundries separating code in classes, making abstraction easier.</p>
                        <h4>Easy to use</h4>
                        <p>Ruby is also very easy to run. There is no building per se, to run is just a matter of typing:</p>
                        <li><code>$ ruby &#60filename&#62 &#60arg0&#62 &#60arg1&#62...</code></li>
                        <p>Any required code from a <code>require</code> statement will be pulled in automatically.</p>
                        <h4>Anonymous functions (lambda)</h4>
                        <p>Ruby also supports lamda expressions, which is a powerful tool when programming.</p>
                        <h4>Blocks</h4>
                        <p>In Java, it is necessary to use a <code>try {} catch {}</code> block in order to do anything with IO. In Ruby, this is abstracted away so all the programmer needs to worry about is writing the line of code that deals with IO.</p>
                        <h4>Inferred Types</h4>
                        <p>Ruby doesn't need to be told whether a variable is a boolean, integer, double, etc. With inferred types, Ruby already knows what the variable's type is. <li><code>array = Array.new(3)</code></li> <p><code>array</code> will be assumed to be of type Array in this case.</p>
